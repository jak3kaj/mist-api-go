package mist
// InventoryUpdateOperation : enum:   * `upgrade_to_mist`: Upgrade to mist-managed   * `downgrade_to_jsi`: Downgrade to basic monitoring. When downgrading a VC member to jsi, we will move the cloud connection of the VC to jsi-terminator and keep all VC device/inventories intact for pain-free upgrading back to mist.   * `assign`: Assign inventory to a site   * `unassign`: Unassign inventory from a site   * `delete`: Delete multiple inventory from org. If the device is already assigned to a site, it will be unassigned
type InventoryUpdateOperation string
