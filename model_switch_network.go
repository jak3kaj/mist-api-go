package mist

// A network represents a network segment. It can either represent a VLAN (then usually ties to a L3 subnet), optionally associate it with a subnet which can later be used to create addition routes. Used for ports doing `family ethernet-switching`. It can also be a pure L3-subnet that can then be used against a port that with `family inet`.
type SwitchNetwork struct {
	// whether to stop clients to talk to each other, default is false (when enabled, a unique isolation_vlan_id is required) NOTE: this features requires uplink device to also a be Juniper device and `inter_switch_link` to be set
	Isolation bool `json:"isolation,omitempty"`
	IsolationVlanId string `json:"isolation_vlan_id,omitempty"`
	// optional for pure switching, required when L3 / routing features are used
	Subnet string `json:"subnet,omitempty"`
	VlanId *AllOfswitchNetworkVlanId `json:"vlan_id"`
}
