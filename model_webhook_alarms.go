// **N.B.**: Fields like `aps`, `bssids`, `ssids` are event specific. They are relevant to this event type ( rogue-ap-detected). For a different event type, different fields may be sent. These don’t contain all affected entities and are representative samples of entities (capped at 10). For marvis action related events, we expose `details` to include more event specific details.  Events specific fields for other alarm event type can be found with API https://api.mist.com/api/v1/const/alarm_defs, under “fields” array of /alarm_defs response object.
